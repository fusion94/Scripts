Scripts
=======

### Description
These are miscellaneous scripts I use reguarly across different platforms. 

Each script is in its own folder, and a README file which contains details of what the script does, how to run it, and any supporting utilities that may be needed for installation.

### License 
All scripts are released under the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0 unless otherwise specified.
